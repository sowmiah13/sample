Git - Distributed Version Control System - that enables to maintain and track changes in a source file & also sharing to others
GitHub - Its a website that allows you to publish git repository online.
Git stores locally - unless you push it to GitHub /dropbox etc.
Central Version Control System and Distributed VCS:

- Central VCS :
- Central VCS has one central rep from where you check files out and check back in.
- Any problem to central rep then only the particular files u checked in will be there.If no back up -total loss
- If servers offline or no network con then u cannot access.
- Distributed VCS :
- Distributed VCS is where each user clones the remote repository - makes changes and pushes in.
- In Distributed VCS ,  each developer has the copy of the central rep.

Repositories:  Remote repository and Local repository .

- Remote Repository : those located in remote server.
- Local Repository : Repository in your local machine.Local rep can be made from scratch or else cloned from a remote rep.

Commits :

- Records changes made to the file.
- Lets others know when and what changes are made to the source file.

Working Tree and Index :

- The files with which you currently work - working tree.
- All changes u make in work tree are not committed. There comes a staging area in between - index- which controls what all files should be taken to commit.
- The files not added to index cannot be committed.

Git files:

- There are two types of files in working directory which are untracked and tracked.'
- Untracked files are those which are not staged and are not observed by git unless you stage them using add command .
- Tracked files may fall under unmodified , modified and stage.
- All files are tracked , unmodified as soon as you clone.then modify -> stage -> commit and the cycle repeats.

Undoing things  :

- git commit --amend : to change the previous commit as the new commit.
- git reset HEAD : to unstage staged files .
 I read them completely.Verified
